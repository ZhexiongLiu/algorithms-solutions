Show that the number of different triples that can be chosen from N items is
precisely N(N-1)(N-2)/6. Hint : Use mathematical induction.

**Proof By Induction**

*Base case:*
If N = 3 then

```
1 = 3*2*1/6
```

*Inductive step:*
Prove that if `N = m` holds then `N = m + 1` holds

If we add one more to N = m + 1
then we have m(m-1)/2 new more ways of combining items

```
(m+1)m(m-1)/6 - m(m-1)(m-2)/6 =
( (m+1)m(m-1) - m(m-1)(m-2) )/6 =
( m(m-1)((m+1) - (m-2)) )/6 =
( m(m-1)3 )/6 =
m(m-1)/2
```

If we try to make pairs from the set N = m (without the new element)
we get `(m-1) + (m-2) + ... + 1` since the m:th elements needs m-1 combinations
and the m-1:th element (m-2) combinations and so on. If we pair up the m-1:th element
with the last and m-2:th element with the second last we get:

`((m-1) + 1) + ((m-2) + 2) + ... + (1 + (m-1))`

So all the pairs sum up to m, and since there is only (m-1)/2 ways of
unique combinations we get `m(m-1)/2`
