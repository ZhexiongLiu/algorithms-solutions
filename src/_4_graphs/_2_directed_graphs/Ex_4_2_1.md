What is the maximum number of edges in a digraph with V vertices and no parallel
edges? What is the minimum number of edges in a digraph with V vertices, none of
which are isolated?

Maximum number of edges: V * (V-1)

Minimum number of edges: V-1 (this assumes that the graph is connected of course)
