Draw the BST that results when you insert the keys E A S Y Q U E S T I O N,
in that order (associating the value i with the ith key, as per the convention in the text)
into an initially empty tree. How many compares are needed to build the tree?

Results in the following tree

            E
          /    \
        A        S
               /   \
              Q     Y
             /      /
            I      U
             \    /
              O  T
             /
            N
