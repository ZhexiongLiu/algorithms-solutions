Show that if a graphâ€™s edges all have distinct weights, the MST is unique.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Cut property: Given any cut in an edge-weighted graph (with all edge weights distinct),
    the crossing edge of minimum weight is in the MST of the graph.

Counter example: If the MST with distinct weights was not unique then another
MST would be possible with the same total weight, but with other edges.
That is not possible since the cut property states that given a cut the minimum
weight edge is in the MST. And since all edges are in a MST are in such a cut no
other MST is possible.
