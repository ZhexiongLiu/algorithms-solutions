 Write a program to find values of a and M, with M as small as possible, such that
 the hash function (a * k) % M for transforming the kth letter of the alphabet into a
 table index produces distinct values (no collisions) for the keys S E A R C H X M P L.
 The result is known as a perfect hash function.
