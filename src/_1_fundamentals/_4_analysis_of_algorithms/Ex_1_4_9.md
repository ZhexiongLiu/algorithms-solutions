Give a formula to predict the running time of a program for a problem of size N
when doubling experiments have shown that the doubling factor is 2b and the running
time for problems of size N0 is T.

------------------------------

**Properties**
* f(N0) = T
* f(N) = 2^b * f(N/2)
* f(N/2) = 2^b * f(N/4)
* f(N/4) = 2^b * f(N/8)

f(N) = 2^b * 2^b * 2^b * ... * 2^b * f(N0)

f(N) = 2^b * 2^b * 2^b * ... * 2^b * T

f(N) = 2^(b+b+b+...+b) * T

f(N) = 2^(b log(N/N0)) * T
