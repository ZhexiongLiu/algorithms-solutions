Suppose that we have an estimate ahead of time of how often search keys are
to be accessed in a BST, and the freedom to insert them in any order that we desire.
Should the keys be inserted into the tree in increasing order, decreasing order of likely
frequency of access, or some other order? Explain your answer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a balanced BST the insertions should be:

(N/2) (N/4, 3N/4) (N/8, 3N/8, 5N/8, 7N/8) ...

assuming the list of indexes are ordered. If we insert the median value
first we will be able to insert the left values to the left of the median
value (root) and the the right values to the right. Continuing this pattern
for the 2 sublists that remain [(0 - N/2-1) (N/2+1 - N)] we take the median of
these two (N/4) and (3N/4) enabling us to insert the 4 remaining sublists in
a balanced way, until we reach the leaves.
