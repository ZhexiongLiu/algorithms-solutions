Draw the tree corresponding to the id[] array depicted below.
Can this be the result of running weighted quick-union?
Explain why this is impossible or give a sequence of operations
that results in this array:

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

Results in the following tree

            1
          / | \
         3  0  6
        / \    /
       2   7  5
             / \
            4   9
           /
          8

This tree is impossible as a result of weighted quick-union, since
if the right subtree with 6 as root is to be merged as a right branch to the
tree with 1 as root, the tree must already have merged the left subtree with 3 as root
and the node 0 to it. In this case the tree would look like

            1
          / |
         3  0
        / \
       2   7

This tree is impossible since the left subtree has weight 3 and before the merge the tree
with 1 as root had weight 2.
